# Impala DDL example

This example has some simple demonstrations of the Impala DDL task showing how it can be used to notify Impala of important data and metadata changes and to generally run a subset of DDL operations commonly used in data ingestion pipelines.

There are three example scenarios provided:

1. Populating a simple un-partitioned table on HDFS
2. Loading data into new partitions in  HDFS
3. Loading data into new range partitions in Kudu

# Setting up the test environment

To prepare the environment for running the tests we first need to populate the `env.conf` file with the relevant parameters for the cluster on which we want to run the tests. All instances of `REPLACEME` should be substituted with the appropriate values. In addition, you will need to provide a keytab called `user.kt` with a user who can create tables and write data to HDFS.

Once the environement is configured, we can setup the test pre-requisites by running the following commands:

```
kinit -kt user.kt <user>
bash setup-tests.sh <impala_host>
```

# Running the tests

The first set of tests are run in client mode and assume a pre-existing Kerberos TGT is available.

## Client mode

Run the tests as follows:

```
bash run-tests.sh <path_to_envelope_jar> <impala_host>
```

The tests run through each of the three scenarios listed above, using Impala to run before-and-after queries to demonstrate data loading. You should see Impala output similar to the following snippets:
